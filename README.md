# Poli_Sci_390

## Welcome to my site!

### About this site:
The purpose of this site is for me to learn the basic skills of data science and apply it to political information in social science. I have the intention of learning data science to use in my future career and also to challenge myself to learn a new skill. I have little experience working with quantitative data, so I hope to become more comfortable with this form and learn to manage and display it with data visualization. My goal is to learn to present political data in a clear, engaging, and appropriate manner and also to question the ethics of displaying data in such a way. This site will demonstrate my progress as I build up these skills and gain a better understanding of data science throughout the course. 

### A little about me:
I am an Anthropology and International Studies major, and I just added a minor in Data Science. I am a complete beginner in Data Science and R and am taking my first data science classes this quarter. I have been conducting research on migration and gender and sexuality. Outside of class and research, I work as a mentor and a tutor. In my freetime, I like to explore the city, take walks, and try new food! ðŸ˜Š
