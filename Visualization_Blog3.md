# Visualization Blog 3: Final project proposal

### Question
**How are affordable housing unit developments and green space distributed and utilized in different communities in Chicago? And what are the implications of economic and social inequality in the current housing crisis?**   

### Potential data sources
- [Affordable Rental Housing Developments](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Affordable-Rental-Housing-Developments-Map/k3g7-7kgc)
- [Chicago Census Data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2)
- [Location Affordability Index](https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/location-affordability-index-v-3/explore?location=12.129159%2C0.315617%2C1.93)
- [Chicago Park Boundaries](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Parks-Recreation/Parks-Chicago-Park-District-Park-Boundaries-curren/ej32-qgdr)

These data sets could be useful for answering my questions because it will give me an understanding of the layout of new housing projects and parks in Chicago as when as general demographic and economic details. It will allow me to explore the economic and social relationship of the number and types of housing developments and parks in each neighborhood or area.

### Visualization inspiration

![Map example 1](images/map_ex.png)
![Map example 2](images/map_ex2.png)

I like the use of different sizes for points in these visualizations which I can use for counts in my visual. In the second visualization, it distinguishes characterists of the map with different colors of area which I think could be useful in my final visual. I'm thinking of using fill to distinguish average income of certain areas of Chicago.

I also like this plot because I think it could be useful for comparing counts of housing and parks and average incomes per area, but I'm unsure of how to incorporate this into a map design. Maybe I can make something like this for additional details on my main visual.
