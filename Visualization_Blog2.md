## Plotting Uncertainty

### Plot 1

I chose to use geom_ribbon to visualize uncertainty because the line is continuous, and I wanted something to wrap around the lines. I made it transparent because the ribbons overlap, and I wanted to make sure your can see all of them.



### Plot 2

I used an error bar to display the error because there are individual points in this plot so the error bar capture the uncertainty of each individual point. I made the bar red to distinguish it from the point and made the ends wider to better see them. I also made the image wider so that it didn't look so cluttered.
