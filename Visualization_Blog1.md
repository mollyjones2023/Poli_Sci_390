## Visualization Blog 1: Just the Basics
### Theme: CONTROVERSY!!! CONTENTION!!!

### #1) A Visualization I Really Like:
![Icarceration Rates Across Different Countries](images/incarceration_global.png)
**I really like this visualization because it is simple and to the point. It is clear in what it wants to represent and the way it chooses to do so. I like how it labels everything clearly and representatively. It has a title that states what the visualization is being used to argue and specifies how this is being measured so that it is as clear as possible: "Incarceration rate per 100,000 people of any age". The value that each country's fills represents is labeled obviously above the map to prevent misinterpretation. The map format makes it easy to view and compare each country and using a rate rather than a total value makes it comparable without being misleading. I like how there are a few but not too many countries across the world pointed out along with the US to make it less of an overwhelming data set since there are so many countries on the map. I also like how there is a note detailing aspects of this image that are not so clear on the map and that the research center that created this visualization is also noted at the bottom.**
